## Using the Interfaucet

You can use the Interfaucet to get free test money, delivered to anywhere on the testnet-of-testnets. The use of the
Interfaucet is based on [version 2 of the Interledger Payment Request standard](https://interledger.org/rfcs/0011-interledger-payment-request/draft-1.html).
Just run the `fund.js` script, and follow the instructions! :)
